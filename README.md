## About the Project

In light of McAllen ISD's new IB Computer Science curriculum, it is important to express the need for aspiring software engineers to become motivated to put their work out for the world to see, judge, and condemn as constructive criticism is vital for growth. This will ultimately allow these students to become role models for the following classes to come. As a part of the first cohort enrolled in this new program, I wanted to take the first step and put my first "service" project on display.

## Usage

This website's literal purpose is to display Lamar Academy student resources, social media redirects, and additional associated websites.
<br>
Subsequently, this website can hopefully inspire other new software developers to act similarly and create software for the school.

## About the Project

With McAllen ISD's new addition of an IB Computer Science program, it is important for aspiring software engineers to become motivated to put their work out for the world to see, judge, and condemn as constructive criticism is vital for growth. I wanted to put my first service "project" on display to show others how awful it is. I believe modesty is essential for development, as it prevents your ego from becoming the death of you. So... what better way to express this than by uploading one of my first works!
<br>
After showing this project to my school, they offered to use the website in place of their linktr.ee. This would have never happened if I kept my work private...

## Usage

This website's literal purpose is to display Lamar Academy student resources, social media redirects, and additional associated websites.
<br>
Subsequently, this website is a demonstration of humility and can hopefully inspire other new software developers to act similarly.
